In this repo you will find various examples using WebSockets and Mojolicious

http://mojolicio.us/

To check out the code using git:

git clone git://github.com/xantus/mojo-websocket-examples.git
cd mojo-websocket-examples
git submodule update --init


Running the examples

For non websocket native browsers, you need a flash policy server running
(port 843, so it needs to run as root)

sudo ./script/flash-policy-server &

then you can run the examples

Note, when running these examples, you shouldn't use http://localhost:3000/
Instead use 127.0.0.1 or another ip local to your box.  Chrome will just refuse to
connect to localhost (or used to?)


Example 1 - Simple echo server

./script/websocket-example-1

Then open http://127.0.0.1:3000/


Example 2 - Simple IRC Client

The server proxies to irc.perl.org, and drops you in #test (you can /join #mojo if you'd like)

./script/websocket-irc-example-1

Then open http://127.0.0.1:3000/

You might want to open multiple tabs or something to talk to yourself
